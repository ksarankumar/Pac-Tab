## 🤔 Why PacTab?

We have all been there: dozens of tabs open, the browser crawling, and no idea
which tabs are even still useful. Most "tab limiters" just **silently kill tabs** —
which is terrifying when you lose something important.

### 🧠 The hidden cost: Chrome eats your RAM

Every open tab is its own little process. Chrome isolates tabs for security and
stability, but that means **each tab consumes real memory** — often **tens to
hundreds of megabytes** depending on the page. Open 30–40 heavy tabs (think
Gmail, YouTube, Docs, Figma, social feeds) and Chrome can quietly devour
**multiple gigabytes of RAM**. The result:

- 🐌 Your whole machine slows down as RAM fills up and the OS starts swapping.
- 🔋 Battery drains faster from background tabs doing work you forgot about.
- 🌀 Switching tabs gets laggy, and Chrome may even discard tabs on its own.

Just like Pac-Man gobbling up everything in sight, **a wall of open tabs gobbles
up your RAM** 🟡👾. PacTab flips the script — it's the Pac-Man that **eats the
clutter for you**, so fewer pointless tabs means **less memory used, a snappier
browser, and longer battery life**.

**PacTab is different.** It keeps you within a tab budget *intelligently*:

- It **never** closes pinned tabs, tabs playing audio, your active tab, or any
  domain you whitelist.
- You choose the strategy — close the **oldest**, the **newest**, or just get a
  **warning**.
- It gives you a **live dashboard** so you are always in control, not surprised.

## 🚀 Installation

PacTab is a standard unpacked Chrome extension — **no build step required**.

1. **Get the code**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pactab.git
   cd pactab
   ```
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Toggle **Developer mode** (top-right corner) **on**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder.
5. Pin **PacTab** to your toolbar (puzzle-piece icon → pin).

> Works in any Chromium-based browser that supports Manifest V3 — Chrome, Edge,
> Brave, Opera, and Arc.

## 🧭 Usage

1. Click the **PacTab** toolbar icon to open the dashboard.
2. Check your **usage bar** and stats (windows, duplicates, domains, auto-closed).
3. Use the quick actions:
   - **Dedupe** — close duplicate tabs across all windows.
   - **Tidy** — apply your tab limit immediately.
   - **Search** — type to filter the tab list.
4. **Click any tab** to jump to it, or **hover and press ✕** to close it.
5. Click the **gear icon** to open **Settings** and configure your budget,
   strategy, protected tabs, and whitelist.

Background auto-limiting works automatically — **no need to restart Chrome**.

## 🔧 How It Works

The background **service worker** is the brain of the extension:

1. It listens for `tabs.onCreated` (and removal/update) events.
2. When a new tab pushes you over your budget within the active **scope**, it:
   - Gathers all tabs in scope.
   - Filters out every **protected** tab (pinned, audible, active, whitelisted).
   - Sorts the remaining "closable" tabs by your chosen **strategy**
     (`oldest` = lowest tab id first, `newest` = highest first).
   - Closes **only the overflow** — never more than needed.
3. It keeps the toolbar **badge** in sync and optionally fires a **notification**.
4. The **dashboard** and **settings** pages talk to the worker through a small
   `chrome.runtime` message API (`getState`, `saveSettings`, `closeDuplicates`,
   `enforceNow`, etc.).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[New tab opened] --> B{Auto-limit enabled?}
    B -- No --> Z[Update badge only]
    B -- Yes --> C{Tabs in scope &gt; limit?}
    C -- No --> Z
    C -- Yes --> D{Strategy = warn?}
    D -- Yes --> N[Show notification]
    D -- No --> E[Filter out protected tabs]
    E --> F[Sort by oldest / newest]
    F --> G[Close only the overflow]
    G --> H[Update badge + stats + notify]
```

## 🏛️ Architecture

PacTab follows a simple, robust **message-driven** architecture. The service
worker owns all state and logic; the UI pages are thin clients.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph UI[User Interface]
        D[dashboard.html / .js / .css]
        S[settings.html / .js / .css]
    end

    subgraph Core[Background]
        SW[service-worker.js]
    end

    subgraph ChromeAPIs[Chrome APIs]
        T[tabs]
        ST[storage.sync / local]
        NO[notifications]
        AC[action / badge]
    end

    D <-- runtime messages --> SW
    S <-- runtime messages --> SW
    SW --> T
    SW --> ST
    SW --> NO
    SW --> AC
```

**Design principles**

- **Single source of truth** — all settings and enforcement live in the worker.
- **Least privilege** — only `tabs`, `storage`, and `notifications` permissions.
- **No dependencies** — pure HTML/CSS/JS; nothing to build or audit.
- **Resilient** — defensive `try/catch` around tab operations that may race.

| Message | Sent by | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getState` | Dashboard / Settings | Returns settings, tabs, window count, stats |
| `saveSettings` | Settings | Persists settings and re-enforces |
| `activateTab` | Dashboard | Focuses a tab and its window |
| `closeTab` / `closeTabs` | Dashboard | Closes one / many tabs |
| `closeDuplicates` | Dashboard | Removes duplicate tabs |
| `enforceNow` | Dashboard | Applies the limit immediately |

## 🔐 Privacy & Permissions

PacTab is built to be **trustworthy by design**:

| Permission | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| `tabs` | Read tab titles/URLs and open/close/activate tabs |
| `storage` | Save your settings and counters |
| `notifications` | Tell you when tabs were tidied (optional) |
| `host_permissions` | Read favicons/titles to render the dashboard |

- **No data leaves your device.** There are no servers, analytics, or accounts.
- Settings sync only through your own Chrome profile (`chrome.storage.sync`).
